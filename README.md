On the [Adobe Flash Player EOL Enterprise Information Page](https://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/enterprise-end-of-life.html), </br>
Adobe announced the official enterprise distributor for Flash Player outside China mainland, HARMAN International.</br>
The Flash Player version that HARMAN provides is v50. In our archive, only ActiveX & PPAPI version available.
### Tech Specs
This version of Flash Player has been limited in the URLs that it can load, to avoid accidental access of potentially malicious content.</br>
If you load a flash content and it is not located on the URL whitelist, the Player will refuse to load and will show the info button.</br>
If you click the button it will lead you to [this page](https://airsdk.harman.com/flashplayer/blocked?url=URL). You can also get more informations at this page.
